# ðŸ§  The Thinking Path â€“ Powered by Logic, Framed in LaTeX

Welcome to my self-initiated learning journey where I attempted to solve 30 logical/mathematical problemsâ€”*without relying on traditional data structure knowledge*.

## ðŸŒŸ What's Inside

- âœ… 30 problems solved using logic, intuition, and structured thinking
- ðŸ§  Daily reasoning based on principles like:
  - Logical Thinking
  - Pattern Deduction
  - Lateral Reasoning
  - Mathematical Intuition
- ðŸ“„ Compiled using **LaTeX** for structured documentation
- ðŸ¤– Supported by **ChatGPT** as a learning assistant

## ðŸ–‹ Blog Post

I wrote about the behind-the-scenes challenges, mental blocks, and how I stayed consistent.

## ðŸš€ Why I Built This

This wasnâ€™t about interview prep or academia.  
I just wanted to challenge the idea that one can't solve problems without formal DSA knowledge.  
Curiosity + consistency = this project.
