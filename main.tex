\mysubsection{The Problem Statement :-}
\problemAnswer{
Given an integer \colorbox{gray!20}{$n$}, find the number of trailing zeros in \colorbox{gray!20}{$n!$} (i.e., \colorbox{gray!20}{$n$} factorial).
}

\problemAnswer{
\subsubsection*{(i) Constraints}
$-$ \colorbox{gray!20}{$1 \leq n \leq 10^9$}  \\
$-$ You are \textbf{not allowed} to compute the actual factorial!
\vspace{0.5em}
\subsubsection*{(ii) Hints:}
$-$ Where do trailing zeros in numbers come from? \\
$-$ What factor(s) in multiplication create zeros at the end? \\
$-$ Can you spot a pattern or rule? 
}

\mysubsection{1. My Thought Process}
\problemAnswer{
$-$ First, I started thinking about how zeros are formed at the end of a number. I realized that every zero at the end comes from a 10, and 10 is made from multiplying 2 and 5. Since there are usually more 2s than 5s in factorials, the number of 5s basically decides how many zeros we get. 
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
$-$ So, I thought: how often does a 5 appear in the factorial? Every time we have a multiple of 5, we get one 5. That means for every 5 numbers, we gain one trailing zero. But then I noticed something more-numbers like 25 (which is $5^2$), 125 (which is $5^3$), etc., contribute more than one 5. So we have to count those extra times too.
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
$-$ That’s when I realized the trick is to divide n by 5, then again by 25, then by 125, and so on. Each time we divide and take the floor value, it tells us how many extra 5s are hiding in those powers. This gives the total number of zeros at the end.
}

\mysubsection{2. The Solution}
\problemAnswer{
\large{Trailing Zeros in $ n! $ =} 
\Large{$\left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{625} \right\rfloor \cdots$}
}

\mysubsection{3. Actual Intuition}
\problemAnswer{
$\cdot$ A trailing zero is created by multiplying a \textbf{2 × 5}. \\
$\cdot$ In \colorbox{gray!20}{$n!$}, there are \textbf{more 2s than 5s}. \\
$\cdot$ So, we count how many times \textbf{5 is a factor} in all numbers from 1 to n. \\
But we also need to include \textbf{25, 125, 625, ...} because numbers like 25 give \textbf{two 5s}, 125 gives \textbf{three 5s}, etc.

\mysubsection{The Problem Statement :-}
\problemAnswer{
Given a non-negative integer \colorbox{gray!20}{$n$}, repeatedly add its digits until the result has only one digit. \\
Return that final one-digit number.
}

\problemAnswer{
\subsubsection*{(i) Constraints:}
$-$ \colorbox{gray!20}{$0 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9$}  \\
$-$ Try to solve this \textbf{without loops or recursion} if possible.
\vspace{0.5em}
\subsubsection*{(ii) Hints:}
$-$ Is there a \textbf{mathematical pattern} in digital root? \\
$-$ Can you find a shortcut?
}

\mysubsection{1. The Solution}
\problemAnswer{
\begin{large}
    If $n=0$, then $result=0$; else, $result=1+((n-1) \, mod \, 9)$
\end{large}
}

\mysubsection{2. Actual Intuition}
\problemAnswer{
This is based on a cool math fact called \textbf{“mod 9 congruence”} - the sum of digits of any number is \textbf{congruent to the number itself modulo 9}.
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
So instead of looping and summing digits again and again, you can just do:
Digital Root of $n=1+((n-1)  mod  9)$

\problemAnswer{
A monkey is trying to climb a tree of height \colorbox{gray!20}{H} meters. \\
Each day it climbs up \colorbox{gray!20}{U} meters, but every night it slips down \colorbox{gray!20}{D} meters. \\
After how many days will the monkey reach or exceed the top of the tree?
\vspace{3pt}

$\bullet$ Inputs:

\colorbox{gray!20}{H}: Total height of the tree. \\
\colorbox{gray!20}{U}: Distance the monkey climbs during the day. \\
\colorbox{gray!20}{D}: Distance the monkey slides down at night. 
\vspace{3pt}

$\bullet$ Output:
Return the \textbf{number of days} it takes to reach the top.
}

\problemAnswer{
\subsubsection*{(i) Constraints:}
$-$ The monkey \textbf{doesn’t slide back} on the \textbf{final day} if it reaches or exceeds the height during the day.  \\
$-$ \colorbox{gray!20}{$ 1 \leq D < U \leq H \leq 10^9 $}
\vspace{0.5em}
\subsubsection*{(ii) Hints:}
$-$ Can you find a formula instead of simulating day by day? \\
$-$ Is there a way to calculate how many \textbf{full cycles} the monkey needs before the final climb?
}

\mysubsection{1. My Thought Process}
\problemAnswer{
$i)$ Let’s say it takes the monkey x days to reach the top of the tree. \\
$ii)$ On the last day, the monkey climbs up and reaches the top during the day, so it doesn’t slide back at night. \\
$iii)$ This means for the first (x - 1) days, the monkey climbs during the day and slides back at night-so the net progress per day is (U-D) meters. \\
$iv)$ By the end of the (x-1) days, the monkey must be close enough to the top that one final climb of U meters will get it to or past the height H. \\
$v)$ So, the total distance that needs to be covered in the first (x-1) days is (H-U). \\
$vi)$ This gives the equation: 
\begin{center}
    $(x-1) \times (U-D)=H-U$
\end{center}
$vii)$ From here, we can solve for x.

\problemAnswer{
You have \colorbox{gray!20}{$n$} bulbs, all turned \textbf{off} initially.\\
You make \colorbox{gray!20}{$n$} passes over them.\\
$\cdot$ \textbf{On the 1st pass, you toggle every bulb (turn it on).}\\

$\cdot$ \textbf{On the 3rd pass, you toggle every 3rd bulb.}\\
$\cdot$ \, '$\cdots$'\\

\vspace*{0.2cm}

After \colorbox{gray!20}{n} passes, how many bulbs are \textbf{on}?
}

\problemAnswer{
\subsubsection*{Hints:}
$-$ When does a bulb end up ON after all toggles? \\
$-$ Try small cases: n = 1 to 10 \\
$-$ Look for a pattern in which positions remain ON.
}

\mysubsection{1. My Thought Process}
\problemAnswer{
$i)$ I wasn’t sure of the pattern at first, so I decided to try a brute-force approach. \\
$ii)$ I checked all possible values of n from 1 to 10. \\
$iii)$ For each value, I manually went through the process to see which switches (or bulbs, etc.) were ON and which were OFF at the end. \\
$iv)$ I carefully counted how many were ON and how many were OFF for each n. \\
$v)$ After doing this for a few values, I started noticing a pattern of $\sqrt{5}$ forming based on the positions that remain ON. 
$vi)$ That helped me understand the logic behind the problem better and made it easier to generalize the answer later.
}

\mysubsection{2. The Solution}
\problemAnswer{
\begin{large}Number of bulb that remains \textbf{ON}=\( \left\lfloor \sqrt{n} \right\rfloor \)\end{large}
}

\mysubsection{3. Actual Intuition}
\problemAnswer{
$-$ A bulb is toggled \textbf{once for every divisor} it has. \\
$-$ Most numbers have \textbf{even} number of divisors \textbf{(paired up)}. \\
$-$ But \textbf{perfect squares} have \textbf{odd number of divisors} - because one of the divisors is repeated (like 4 has divisors 1,2,4 - 2 appears only once). \\
$\cdot$ So only \textbf{bulbs at perfect square positions} (1, 4, 9, 16...) will be ON after all passes.

\textbf{Procedures to Solve It:}

1. Simulate day by day, keeping track of seen states. \\

\mysubsection{2. Core Intuition}
\problemAnswer{
$\cdot$ To find the state of the prison cells after \( N \) days, follow these steps: \\
$i)$ Each cell updates daily based on its two adjacent neighbors (left and right). \\
$ii)$ A cell becomes 1 (occupied) if both neighbors are either occupied (1) or both vacant (0). \\
$iii)$ If the neighbors are different, the cell becomes 0 (vacant). \\
$iv)$ The first and last cells always become 0, as they do not have two neighbors. \\
$v)$ Repeat this process for \( N \) days, updating all cells simultaneously each day. \\
$vi)$ Since there are only a limited number of possible states (256), the sequence will eventually enter a cycle (repeat itself). \\
$vii)$ If a cycle is detected, use it to skip ahead: \\
Instead of simulating all \( N \) days, compute \( N \mod \text{cycle\_length} \) and simulate only the remaining steps. \\
This approach ensures correctness and efficiency, even for large values of \( N \).

Try small values of \colorbox{gray!20}{n = 1} to \colorbox{gray!20}{10}, and look for a pattern: \\
$-$ Who wins at \colorbox{gray!20}{n = 1, 2, 3, 4}? \\
$-$ What do the losing positions have in common?
}

\mysubsection{1. My Thought Process}
\problemAnswer{
$i)$ At first, I didn’t know the winning strategy, so I decided to use brute force and try out small values of n. \\
$ii)$ I went from n = 1 to around n = 10 and looked at all possible moves I could make: removing 1, 2, or 3 stones. \\
$iii)$ For each case, I asked myself: \\
\hspace*{5pt} $-$ "If I take 1 stone now, what will my opponent be left with?" \\
\hspace*{5pt} $-$ "Can they win from there if they play optimally?" \\
\hspace*{5pt} $-$ I repeated this for taking 2 and 3 stones too. \\
$iv)$ I noticed that if the number of stones was a multiple of 4, I would always end up losing no matter what I played-because whatever I do, my opponent can always bring it back to a multiple of 4. \\
$v)$ But if it’s not a multiple of 4, I can always make a move that gives my opponent a multiple of 4, putting them in the losing position. \\
$vi)$ So I realized the pattern: \\

$(i)$ Each time you do \colorbox{gray!20}{$n$ \& $(n - 1)$}, it \textbf{removes the lowest set bit (1)} from \colorbox{gray!20}{$n$}. \\

\mysubsection{1. My Thought Process}
\problemAnswer{
I thought: maybe we can express :
$$n=2x+3y+1$$
This would model the operations as combinations of "divide-by-2" and "divide-by-3" steps, along with an adjustment (like a +1 or similar). \\
The idea is to represent $n$ in terms of the operations allowed. However, this might not always be straightforward - a purely greedy approach (always choosing one operation when available) may not yield the optimal solution. \\
So at each step, we may need to carefully consider both options (dividing by 2 or by 3) and sometimes even simulate both paths to see which leads to a better or shorter solution.

I first considered jumping in steps of 2, covering all multiples of 2 up to 100 — which gives 50 steps. Next, I considered jumping in steps of 3, covering all multiples of 3 up to 100 — giving 33 steps. However, some numbers like 6 appear in both sequences (i.e., multiples of both 2 and 3), so I subtracted the overlapping numbers. There are 16 such overlaps (multiples of 6), so I calculated the unique numbers as $50+33-16=67$. \\
Then, I added the prime numbers less than or equal to 100 that are not multiples of 2 or 3. These are 23 in total, bringing the final count to $67+23=90$.

\mysubsection{3. Actual Intuition}
\problemAnswer{
\textbf{$\bullet$ Key Idea:} 
\vspace*{0.2cm}

$\cdot$ With \textbf{one egg}, you could only do \textbf{linear search}: drop from floor $1, 2, 3, \cdots$ until it breaks $\rightarrow$ up to 100 drops. \\
$\cdot$ With \textbf{two eggs}, you can be \textbf{smarter}: \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ Use the \textbf{first egg} to "probe" floors in a smart way. \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ When it breaks, \textbf{use the second egg} to linearly search floor by floor below where the first egg broke.
\vspace*{0.1cm}

\textbf{So:} The strategy should balance the two: \\
$\cdot$ If you jump floors too much with the first egg, you may have to linear search a lot with the second. \\
$\cdot$ If you jump floors too little, you waste moves. \\
The number of drops \textbf{never exceeds 14}, whether the egg breaks early or late. \\
This is based on a \textbf{cumulative search plan}, not prime numbers or divisibility.
\vspace*{0.5cm}

\textbf{$\bullet$ Simple example:} 
\vspace*{0.2cm}

Suppose you drop the first egg at floor 14: \\
$\cdot$ If it breaks, you have at most 1–13 floors below it. You use the second egg linearly to find exactly where. \\
$\cdot$ If it doesn't break, you go up 13 floors (14 + 13 = 27), and drop again. \\
$\cdot$ If it doesn't break again, you go up 12 floors (27 + 12 = 39), and so on. \\
The number of drops \textbf{never exceeds 14}, whether the egg breaks early or late. \\

\textbf{General Formula:}

$\bullet$ Use \textbf{Binary encoding}:
\vspace*{0.2cm}

$\cdot$ You can represent each bottle number using binary. \\

\vspace*{0.5cm}

\textbf{$\bullet$ Step-by-step logic:} 
\vspace*{0.2cm}

$1.$ Number the 1000 bottles from \colorbox{gray!20}{$0$} to \colorbox{gray!20}{$999$}. \\
$2.$ Convert each number to its 10-bit binary form. \\
$3.$ Assign each of the 10 \textbf{slaves} to represent one bit position (e.g., slave 1 = bit 0, slave 2 = bit 1, ..., slave 10 = bit 9). \\
$4.$ If a bottle has a \colorbox{gray!20}{$1$} in a certain bit position, the corresponding slave drinks from that bottle. \\
$5.$ After 10 hours, each slave will either be alive (\colorbox{gray!20}{$0$}) or dead (\colorbox{gray!20}{$1$}). \\
$6.$ The combination of which slaves died gives a \textbf{10-bit binary number}, which directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle’s number.
\vspace*{0.5cm}

\textbf{$\bullet$ Example:} 
\vspace*{0.2cm}

Bottle \# 845 $\rightarrow$ binary is \colorbox{gray!20}{1101001101} \\
$\cdot$ Slaves \# 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 10 drink it. \\
$\cdot$ If they die, and the others live $\rightarrow$ read the bits from their deaths = \colorbox{gray!20}{1101001101} = 845 $\rightarrow$ \textbf{bingo}.
}
\problemAnswer{
\textbf{$\bullet$ Who drinks what?} 
\vspace*{0.2cm}

Each slave drinks from \textbf{all bottles where their assigned bit is 1}. \\
So: \\
$-$ A slave may drink from $\sim$ 500 bottles (not all 1000). \\
$-$ Some bottles make multiple slaves drink (e.g., bottle 511 makes 9 slaves drink). \\
Yes, this is a \textbf{lot of sips per person}, but it's way better than needing 1000 people.

    \textbf{The starting number $\leq$ 100 that produces the longest sequence is \colorbox{gray!20}{97}, with length 118.}
\end{large}
}

\mysubsection{2. Intuition}
\problemAnswer{
While the final answer (97) is found using brute-force simulation, there's deeper reasoning behind why this is \textbf{necessary} and \textbf{non-obvious}:
\vspace*{0.5cm}

\textbf{1. Unpredictable Growth}:
\vspace*{0.2cm}

$-$ The \textbf{Collatz function} mixes two operations: divide by $2$ (shrinks) and $3n + 1$ (grows). \\
$-$ This makes the sequence \textbf{non-monotonic} - it doesn’t always go down. \\
$-$ A small number can grow \textbf{very large} before reducing to 1.
\vspace*{0.5cm}

\textbf{2. Sequence Length $\neq$ Size}:
\vspace*{0.2cm}

$-$ Larger starting numbers don’t always mean longer sequences. \\
$-$ For example: \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ 100 $\rightarrow$ 25 steps \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ 99 $\rightarrow$ 25 steps \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ 98 $\rightarrow$ 25 steps \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ 99 $\rightarrow$ 25 steps \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ 97 $\rightarrow$ 118 steps \textbf{(the longest)} \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ 96 $\rightarrow$ 12 steps \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ 95 $\rightarrow$ 105 steps \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ 94 $\rightarrow$ 105 steps \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ 93 $\rightarrow$ 17 steps \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ $\cdots$ 
\vspace*{0.5cm}

\textbf{3. Why Brute Force Is Needed}:
\vspace*{0.2cm}

$-$ Due to the chaotic and recursive nature of the function, there’s \textbf{no known formula} to directly calculate sequence length. \\
$-$ So we use brute force - trying each number and simulating the steps - to find the longest one. 
\vspace*{0.5cm}

\textbf{$\bullet$ So the intuition is:} 
\vspace*{0.2cm}

Because the \textbf{Collatz function} causes numbers to behave chaotically - sometimes rising high before falling - we can’t predict the longest sequence analytically. That’s why we simulate all values from 1 to 100. Among them, 97 happens to produce the longest journey to 1.

\problemAnswer{
\textbf{Estimating the Number of Folds to Reach Mount Everest (8848 m) - Intuitive \& Calculative Approach:}
\vspace*{0.5cm}

\textbf{1. Step-by-Step Reasoning (No Calculator)}:
\vspace*{0.2cm}

$-$ Rearranging the inequality 
$$2^n \geq 8848 \times 10^4 = 8.848 \times 10^7$$
Now, mentally estimate when $2^n$ exceeds $8.848 \times 10^7$

$-$ Mental Approximation Using Known Powers of 2 \\
Memorize key benchmarks:
\vspace*{0.1cm}

$\cdot$ $2^{3.\cdots} \approx 8.\cdots$ \\
$\cdot$ $2^{10} \approx 10^3 = 1000$ \\
$\cdot$ $2^{20} \approx 10^6 = 1 \text{million}$ \\
$\cdot$ $2^{30} \approx 10^9 = 1 \text{billion}$ \\
Try:
\vspace*{0.1cm}

$\cdot$ $2^{26} = 2^6\times2^{20} = 64\times10^6 = 64,000,000$ \\
$\cdot$ $2^{27} = 128\times2^6 = 128,000,000$ 
\vspace*{0.1cm}

So:
$$2^3 \times 2^{10} \times 2^{10} \times 2^3 = 2^{3+10+10+3} = 2^{26}$$
Then you say, let’s call it $2^{3.\cdots} \times 2^{10.\cdots} \times 2^{10.\cdots} \times 2^{3.\cdots} = 2^{(3+10+10+3).\cdots} = 2^{26.\cdots} \approx 2^{27}$ - which is \textbf{very reasonable}, because you're compensating for approximation.
\vspace*{0.5cm}

\textbf{2. Calculation (Exact)}:
\vspace*{0.2cm}

$-$ Start from the inequality:
$$10^{-4} \times 2^n \geq 8848 \Rightarrow 2^n \geq 8848 \times 10^{4} = 8.848 \times 10^7$$
$-$ Take base-2 logarithm on both sides: 
$$n \geq \log_2(8.848 \times 10^7)$$
$-$ Break it down using properties of logs:
$$n \geq \log_2(8.848) + \log_2(10^7) \Rightarrow n \geq \log_2(8.848) + 7\log_2(10)$$
}
\problemAnswer{
Using known approximations: \\
$\cdot$ $\log_2(8.848) \approx 3.14$ \\
$\cdot$ $\log_2(10) \approx 3.3219$ \\
So:
$$n \geq 3.14 + 7\times3.3219 = 3.14 + 23.2533 = 26.3933$$
Since $n$ must be an integer, \textbf{$n = 27$} folds are required.

You are on an island that is \textbf{perfectly circular} and completely surrounded by water. \\
At midnight, it starts raining. A \textbf{flood begins}, and the water rises \textbf{uniformly and steadily} around the island.
\vspace*{0.2cm} 

You are standing at a \textbf{random point on the island}. You know: \\
$-$ The island is \textbf{symmetrical and flat}, like a giant disk. \\
$-$ The water will \textbf{reach the center in exactly 60 minutes}. \\
$-$ You can walk at a \textbf{constant speed}, and your \textbf{goal is to survive} by reaching the \textbf{edge of the island} before the water cuts you off.

\textbf{What is the optimal strategy to guarantee your survival?} \\
Also, \textbf{how many minutes will it take in the worst-case scenario?} \\

\mysubsection{1. The Solution}
\problemAnswer{
\begin{large}
   Walk in an outward spiral path - specifically, an Archimedean spiral, where the radius increases linearly with the angle you’ve walked.
\end{large}
}

\mysubsection{2. Intuition}
\problemAnswer{
\textbf{$\bullet$ Spiral Path Strategy:} \\
$-$ Start walking in a \textbf{logarithmic spiral} outward from the center. \\
$-$ This spiral ensures that \textbf{no matter what direction you’re facing}, you will \textbf{eventually reach the edge} - without ever needing to know which way you're going.
\vspace*{0.4cm}

\textbf{$\bullet$ Worst-case Time Taken:} 
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
The worst-case time required with this strategy is approximately: 
\vspace{0.2cm} \\
\hspace*{11pt} 2.278 minutes per unit of radius × island’s radius \\
\hspace*{11pt} Since you can walk from center to edge in 60 minutes, your radius unit is 1 $\rightarrow$ So: \\
\hspace*{11pt} 2.278 × 60 $\approx$ 137 minutes \\
So the worst-case time it takes to reach the edge using the spiral path is about 137 minutes.
\vspace{0.2cm} \\
That’s over twice as long - but it’s the only deterministic survival strategy if you're blindfolded and disoriented.
\vspace*{0.4cm}

$\Rightarrow$ \textbf{Why Spiral Works:} 
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
Unlike the straight-line method (which can fail catastrophically), the spiral: \\
$\cdot$ \textbf{Always moves outward,} \\
$\cdot$ \textbf{Sweeps every direction,} \\
$\cdot$ \textbf{Eventually reaches the boundary, no matter which way you started.}
\vspace{0.1cm} \\
Yes - it takes up to \textbf{137 minutes}, but because the spiral grows \textbf{outward}, you'll \textbf{reach the edge before the water reaches you}, as long as your \textbf{radial distance increases faster than the water’s}.
\vspace{0.1cm} \\
\hspace*{11pt} In other words: the spiral must be tuned so that the \textbf{radial component of your speed} ensures you reach radius = 1 (i.e., the edge) \textbf{before t = 60 minutes}.
\vspace{0.1cm} \\
And that’s \textbf{exactly} how the spiral is constructed - it spreads outward fast enough so that \textbf{you escape before drowning}.
\vspace*{0.4cm}

\textbf{$\bullet$ So What’s the Real Deal?}
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
i) Straight-line (blindfolded): \textbf{Not safe}, takes \textbf{up to 120 mins}, and you drown after 60. \\
ii) Spiral path: \textbf{Always safe, guarantees escape} before 60 minutes radius is overtaken - even though \textbf{total path length} is $\sim$ 137 mins, the radial escape happens \textbf{within 60 minutes}.

You're given \textbf{two sealed envelopes}. \\
Each contains \textbf{a positive amount of money}, and one of them has \textbf{exactly twice as much as} the other.
\vspace*{0.2cm} 

You’re told: \\
\hspace*{11pt} “Pick one envelope. You can open it and look inside. Then decide whether to \textbf{keep it or switch}.”
\vspace*{0.2cm} 

You pick one envelope, open it, and find \textbf{1,000} inside.
\vspace*{0.2cm}

You start reasoning: \\
\hspace*{11pt} “There’s a 50\% chance this is the smaller amount, so the other envelope has 2,000. \\
There’s also a 50\% chance this is the larger amount, so the other one has 500. \\
So expected value of switching = (0.5 × 2,000) + (0.5 × 500) = 1,250 \\
That’s more than 1,000... So I should always switch!”
\vspace*{0.2cm} 

But wait - that logic would make you \textbf{keep switching forever}.
\vspace*{0.2cm}

$\bullet$ \textbf{Question:} \\
\textbf{Where is the flaw in this reasoning?} \\
Why is the “expected value” argument \textbf{wrong}, even though it looks solid? \\
Think carefully - no calculations required, just \textbf{clarity of thought}.
}

\mysubsection{1. My Thought Process}
\problemAnswer{
No, I think when considering expected value, we should factor in profit or loss. \\
The expected value here is: (0.5 × 1000) + (0.5 × 500) = 750. \\
Since the probability of losing 500 is equal to the chance of gaining 1000, the expected value favors keeping. \\
So, we should choose to keep.
}

\mysubsection{2. Actual Logic}
\problemAnswer{
\textbf{$\bullet$ Core issue:} 
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
You \textbf{cannot assign equal 50/50 probabilities} after seeing 1,000 unless you know the prior distribution of money amounts. 
\vspace*{0.4cm}

\textbf{$\bullet$ Why?} 
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
Let’s say the envelopes contain \textbf{X and 2X}. \\
If you open 1,000, then the two possibilities are: 
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
$-$ 1,000 = X $\rightarrow$ other envelope has 2,000 \\
$-$ 1,000 = 2X $\rightarrow$ other envelope has 500 
\vspace*{0.2cm}

But \textbf{both scenarios are not equally likely.}
\vspace*{0.2cm}

To compute actual probabilities, you’d need to know:
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
$-$ How likely the game was to include a 500/1,000 pair \\
$-$ Versus a 1,000/2,000 pair \\
$-$ That depends on how the amounts were chosen before the game (the prior distribution)
\vspace*{0.4cm}

\textbf{$\bullet$ The illusion:} 
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
The logic \textbf{pretends} to use expected value, but it \textbf{treats your 1,000 as a fixed number} without accounting for how likely that amount actually is in the setup.
\vspace*{0.2cm} 

It’s like saying: \\
\hspace*{11pt} “No matter what number I see, switching is better”
But that leads to an \textbf{infinite loop of switching} - which is irrational.
\vspace*{0.2cm} 

So: \\
$-$ The expected value calculation isn’t wrong in math \\
$-$ It’s \textbf{wrong in context}, because it \textbf{misuses probabilities} that depend on unknowns.

\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
Now we see the actual rule:
\vspace*{0.2cm}

\textbf{$\bullet$  Rule:} 
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
For day \colorbox{gray!20}{n}, the code is:

$\cdot$ \textbf{1st letter:} \colorbox{gray!20}{'A' + (n - 1)} \\

$\cdot$ \textbf{3rd letter:} \colorbox{gray!20}{'N' + (n - 1)}

$\cdot$ 'M' + 1 = N \\
$\cdot$ 'N' + 1 = O $\rightarrow$ But wait, it says BFO instead? \\
\hspace*{5pt} That doesn’t match. \\
BUT here’s the {twist}: the \textbf{second and third letters} follow a \textbf{different base} than the first one.
}

\problemAnswer{
Look again at positions:
\vspace*{0.3cm} \\
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 Date & Code  & 1st & 2nd & 3rd \\ \hline
 1    & A M N & 65  & 77  & 78  \\ 
 2    & B F O & 66  & 70  & 79  \\ 
 3    & C G P & 67  & 71  & 80  \\ 
 4    & D H Q & 68  & 72  & 81  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
The second letters go: M, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M \\
Which is \textbf{cyclically repeating} through \textbf{F to N}
\vspace*{0.2cm}

So it looks like: \\
$-$ \textbf{1st letter:} A to Z $\rightarrow$ increment by 1 \\
$-$ \textbf{2nd letter:} F to N $\rightarrow$ cycles every 9 \\
$-$ \textbf{3rd letter:} O to Z then wraps
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
We don’t have to fully decode each rule because you \textbf{identified the increasing logic} - and based on this...
\vspace*{0.4cm}

$\Rightarrow$ \textbf{For day 26:} 
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
Let’s go from \textbf{A} $\rightarrow$ 1st letter = \colorbox{gray!20}{Z} \\
Now second letter (26th in cycle): \\
Look back: M(1), F(2), G(3), ..., the cycle from F to N is 9 letters \\
So index 26 $\rightarrow$ position (26 \% 9) = 8 $\rightarrow$ 8th letter in [F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N] = \colorbox{gray!20}{M}
\vspace*{0.2cm}

Third letter starts from N (ASCII 78) + 25 = 103 $\rightarrow$ ASCII 103 = \textbf{g} 
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
So final answer = \textbf{ZMg} - but that has a \textbf{lowercase} letter, which seems off
Let’s instead assume third letter wraps after Z: \\
$\cdot$ Start at N (78), +25 = 103 $\rightarrow$ 103 > 'Z' (90), so we wrap around: \\
\hspace*{11pt} ('N' + 25 - 26) = 'M' \\
So third letter is \colorbox{gray!20}{M}

\textbf{$\bullet$ Assume C is a truth-teller.}
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
C says: “A and B are liars.” \\
If C is telling the truth, then:
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
$\cdot$ A is a liar \\
$\cdot$ B is a liar
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
Check if this is consistent with what A and B say:
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
$\cdot$ A says: “B is a liar.” \\
\hspace*{5pt} But A is a liar $\rightarrow$ this statement is \textbf{false $\rightarrow$ B is not a liar} $\rightarrow$ contradiction! \\
\hspace*{5pt} (We assumed B is a liar, but now we get B is not a liar.)
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
$\Rightarrow$ \textbf{Inconsistency! So C cannot be a truth-teller.} 
\vspace*{0.2cm}

\textbf{$\bullet$ Assume C is a liar.} 
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
C says: “A and B are liars.” \\
If C is lying, the statement is false $\rightarrow$ “A and B are not both liars.” \\
This means: \textbf{at least one of A or B is a truth-teller}.
\vspace*{0.3cm} 

Let’s now test both A and B.
\vspace*{0.3cm} \\
\textbf{case 1: Try A is a truth-teller:} 
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
A says: “B is a liar.” $\rightarrow$ A is truthful $\rightarrow$ B is a liar.
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
Check B's statement: “C is a liar.” \\
But B is a liar $\rightarrow$ the statement is \textbf{false $\rightarrow$ C is not a liar} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{contradiction} (we assumed C is a liar)!
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
$\Rightarrow$ \textbf{Inconsistency! So A cannot be a truth-teller.} 
\vspace*{0.2cm} 

\textbf{case 2: Try B is a truth-teller:} 
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
B says: “C is a liar.” $\rightarrow$ B is truthful $\rightarrow$ C is a liar (matches assumption)
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
Now check A’s statement: “B is a liar.” \\
But A is a liar (we haven’t assumed it, but we’ll verify). \\
If A is a liar, then their statement “B is a liar” is false $\rightarrow$ so B is not a liar $\rightarrow$ consistent (B is a truth-teller).

\problemAnswer{
$\bullet$ \textbf{Summary of the Logic} 
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
$-$ C cannot be a truth-teller because that leads to contradiction. \\
$-$ Assuming C is a liar, and B is a truth-teller leads to a consistent assignment: \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ B says C is a liar $\rightarrow$ true. \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ A (a liar) says B is a liar $\rightarrow$ false $\rightarrow$ B is a truth-teller. \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ C (a liar) says both A and B are liars $\rightarrow$ false $\rightarrow$ at least one of them is a truth-teller $\rightarrow$ satisfied.

\mysubsection{The Problem Statement :-}
\problemAnswer{
\textbf{The Missing Number Puzzle:}
\vspace*{0.3cm} \\
You are given the following pattern:

\problemAnswer{
2 $\rightarrow$ 4  \\
3 $\rightarrow$ 9  \\
4 $\rightarrow$ 16  \\
5 $\rightarrow$ 25  \\
6 $\rightarrow$ 36  \\
7 $\rightarrow$ 49  \\
8 $\rightarrow$ 64  \\
9 $\rightarrow$ 81  \\
10 $\rightarrow$ ?
}

Now, that’s easy, right? But wait...
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
Then you're given another version of the same puzzle with a twist: 

\problemAnswer{
2 $\rightarrow$ 4  \\
3 $\rightarrow$ 8  \\
4 $\rightarrow$ 15  \\
5 $\rightarrow$ 24  \\
6 $\rightarrow$ 35  \\
7 $\rightarrow$ 48  \\
8 $\rightarrow$ 63  \\
9 $\rightarrow$ 80  \\
10  ?
}

$\bullet$ \textbf{Your Task:} \\
Find the missing number for 10 in the second pattern.
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
Don’t just look - think! What changed? 
}

\mysubsection{1. The Solution}
\problemAnswer{
\begin{large}
    \colorbox{gray!20}{10 $\rightarrow$ 99}
\end{large}
}

\mysubsection{2. Analysis}
\problemAnswer{
\textbf{$\bullet$ For first pattern:}
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
This is clearly:
\begin{align*}
n &\rightarrow n^2 \\
i.e. \, 10 &\rightarrow 100
\end{align*}
}

\problemAnswer{
\textbf{$\bullet$ For second pattern:} 
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
Let’s analyze the differences:
\vspace*{0.3cm} \\
\begin{tabular}{|c||c||c|}
\hline
 n & Output & Difference from n² \\ \hline
 2 & 4      & 2² = 4 → 0         \\
 3 & 8      & 3² = 9 → -1        \\
 4 & 15     & 4² = 16 → -1       \\
 5 & 24     & 5² = 25 → -1       \\
 6 & 35     & 6² = 36 → -1       \\
 7 & 48     & 7² = 49 → -1       \\
 8 & 63     & 8² = 64 → -1       \\
 9 & 80     & 9² = 81 → -1       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\vspace*{0.2cm}

So from \textbf{n = 3 onward}, the pattern is: \\
$n \rightarrow n^2 - 1$
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
Hence: \\
$10 \rightarrow 10^2-1 = 100-1 =99$
\vspace*{0.4cm}

$\Rightarrow$ \textbf{Summary:} 
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
The trick was in \textbf{spotting where the rule changes}: \\
At \colorbox{gray!20}{$n = 2$,} output is $n^2$, but from n = 3 onward, it's $n^2 - 1$.

\mysubsection{The Problem Statement :-}
\problemAnswer{
A wall clock is broken in such a way that \textbf{it runs 6 minutes slow every hour}.
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
One day, you set the correct time on it at \textbf{12:00 noon}. \\
Later that day, when you look at the clock again, it shows \textbf{3:00 PM}.
\vspace*{0.3cm} 

$\bullet$ \textbf{Your Task:} \\
\textbf{What is the actual time when the broken clock shows 3:00 PM?}
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
Give your answer in \textbf{HH:MM format}.
}

\mysubsection{1. My Thought Process}
\problemAnswer{
I initially assumed that if the clock lags by 6 minutes every hour, then when the clock shows 3:00, the actual time could be 3:18.
}

\mysubsection{2. The Solution}
\problemAnswer{
\begin{large}
    \colorbox{gray!20}{3:20 PM}
    \vspace*{0.1cm} \\
    So the actual time is \textbf{03:20 PM} when the broken clock shows \textbf{03:00 PM}.
\end{large}
}

\mysubsection{3. Actual Intuition}
\problemAnswer{
\textbf{$\bullet$ Clock loses 6 minutes every hour.}
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
That means: \\
$-$ For \textbf{every 60 minutes} of real time, \\
$-$ The clock shows only \textbf{54 minutes}.
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
So the clock is running at 90\% speed (54/60 = 0.9).
\vspace*{0.2cm} 

\textbf{\large{When the broken clock shows 3:00 PM, how much real time has passed?}}
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
From \textbf{12:00 PM to 3:00 PM}, the clock thinks \textbf{3 hours} have passed = \textbf{180 minutes (broken clock time)}.
}
\problemAnswer{
\hspace*{5pt} Let real time passed = \textbf{x} minutes. \\
\hspace*{5pt} We know the broken clock shows \textbf{90\% of real time}, so: 
\begin{align}
    0.9 \times x &= 180 \\
    \Rightarrow x &= 200 minutes
\end{align}
So \textbf{200 minutes of real time} passed after 12:00 PM:
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
$\Rightarrow$ 200 minutes = 3 hours 20 minutes
}

\problemAnswer{
$\bullet$ \textbf{Another Approach: Compounding Lag using Geometric Series} 
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
Instead of setting up equations, you can understand the time difference using the idea of \textbf{compounding lag} - where the clock’s delay keeps adding on itself.
\vspace*{0.3cm} 

$-$ \textbf{Key Points:}
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
1. The clock loses 6 minutes every hour, which means it's running at \textbf{90\% speed} (i.e., 10\% slow). \\
2. When the broken clock shows \textbf{3:00 PM}, it has supposedly run for \textbf{3 clock hours}, i.e., \textbf{180 minutes}. \\
3. Over that time, the clock should have lagged \textbf{18 minutes} - but: \\
\hspace*{5pt} $\cdot$ That \textbf{18 minutes also occurred under the slow clock}, so the lag during those minutes wasn’t accounted for. \\
4. So we add \textbf{10\% of 18 minutes}, then \textbf{10\% of that}, and so on:
$$\textbf{Total lag} = 18+1.8+0.18+\cdots$$
5. This forms a \textbf{geometric series}:
$$\textbf{Total lag} = \frac{18}{1- \frac{1}{10}}=\frac{1.8}{0.9}=20 \text{min}$$
6. So the \textbf{}{actual time} is: \\
\textbf{3:00 PM + 20 minutes = 3:20 PM}
\vspace*{0.2cm}

$-$ \textbf{Why This Works:} \\
You're accounting for the \textbf{compounding nature} of lag - each correction brings in a bit more error, just like interest compounding over time.

\mysubsection{The Problem Statement :-}
\problemAnswer{
\textbf{The Setup:} \\
$-$ There are \textbf{100 prisoners}, each kept in solitary confinement. \\
$-$ There is a \textbf{single room} with a \textbf{light bulb} (initially off). \\
$-$ The warden will \textbf{randomly pick one prisoner} each day to visit the light bulb room. He can choose the \textbf{same prisoner multiple times}, and the others won’t know who visited when. \\
$-$ Prisoners can \textbf{toggle} the light bulb (on → off or off → on) or leave it unchanged.
$-$ They can use the light bulb as a tool to \textbf{communicate indirectly}.
$-$ At any point, \textbf{any prisoner can declare that all 100 prisoners have visited the room at least once}.
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
If they're \textbf{correct}, everyone is set free. \\
If they’re \textbf{wrong}, all are \textbf{executed}.
\vspace*{0.3cm} 

$\bullet$ \textbf{Your Task:} \\
Devise a \textbf{strategy} the prisoners could agree upon \textbf{before} the visits start, to \textbf{guarantee} freedom eventually - \textbf{no guessing}, just logic.
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
You don’t need to code - just explain the \textbf{core idea} of the strategy clearly.
}

\mysubsection{1. My Thought Process}
\problemAnswer{
At first, I considered the case where a new person goes for the first time, and the light is either turned on, off, or turned on again so that the next person sees a fading light — but none of these approaches seemed to work.
}

\mysubsection{2. Core Idea}
\problemAnswer{
\textbf{$\bullet$ Strategy (agreed beforehand):}
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
1. Choose \textbf{one prisoner} as the \textbf{"counter"} - the only one who is responsible for tracking how many unique prisoners have visited. \\
2. The other \textbf{99 prisoners} are \textbf{"non-counters."}
\vspace*{0.3cm} 

\textbf{\large{Light Bulb Communication Rules:}}
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
$\bullet$ \textbf{For Non-Counters:}
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
$-$ Each non-counter \textbf{remembers whether they've ever turned ON the bulb}. \\
$-$ If they \textbf{enter the room and the light is OFF}, and they \textbf{have never turned it ON before}, they \textbf{turn it ON}  exactly \textbf{once} in their lifetime. \\
$-$ If they already turned it ON once, or the bulb is ON when they enter - \textbf{do nothing}.
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
$\bullet$ \textbf{For the Counter:}
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
$-$ Every time the \textbf{counter enters and finds the light ON}, they: \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ Turn it OFF. \\
\hspace*{11pt} $\cdot$ Increase their mental count by 1.
\vspace*{0.3cm} 

$\bullet$ \textbf{How It Works:} 
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
$-$ Every time a non-counter gets to the room for the \textbf{first time}, and the bulb is OFF, they signal their visit by turning it ON. \\
$-$ Eventually, the counter will visit and see the bulb ON - and know \textbf{someone new} has visited. \\
$-$ After the counter has turned the bulb OFF \textbf{99 times}, they know that all 99 other prisoners have visited.
\vspace*{0.2cm} \\
At that point, the counter can \textbf{declare confidently} that all prisoners have visited.
\vspace*{0.3cm} 

$\bullet$ \textbf{Edge Cases Covered:}
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
$-$ Even if some prisoners are picked repeatedly early on, the system still works. \\
$-$ Patience is key - the process may take \textbf{many days}, but it is \textbf{guaranteed to finish eventually.}
\vspace*{0.2cm}

$\Rightarrow$ \textbf{Final Declaration:} 
\vspace*{0.1cm} \\
Once the \textbf{counter reaches 99}, they declare: \\
\hspace*{11pt} \textbf{"All 100 prisoners have visited the room!"} \\
Everyone is freed.
