1. Initial Layout Issues
When I started, I struggled with structuring tcolorbox environments—especially with placing titles inside vs. outside the box. Indentation, box shapes, and inconsistent alignment made the output look clumsy and unrefined.

2. Displaying Python Code Cleanly
As I began writing logic-heavy solutions in Python, I needed a way to display them clearly. I figured out how to render code using the listings package inside a shaded box with line numbers. Creating a reusable command for this made my LaTeX more efficient and visually clean.

3. Managing Vertical and Horizontal Spacing
Rather than relying on \vspace and \hspace, I chose to use their starred versions — \vspace* and \hspace*. Why? Because the starred versions forcefully insert space, even at the top or bottom of a page, where normal \vspace might be ignored. This gave me more reliable control over layout, especially around section breaks or page transitions.

4. Custom Section/Subsection Commands
I created custom commands for sections and subsections (like \mysection and \mysubsection) that allowed me to stylize headers and simultaneously auto-generate a clean table of contents.

5. Day Separator Design
I wanted to clearly mark different problem-solving days. I built a custom dotted line separator using TikZ, fine-tuned for symmetry and aesthetic spacing, making transitions between entries visually intuitive.

6. Header/Footer Tweaks
I learned to customize page headers using the fancyhdr package, eventually excluding them from the first few pages where I had a title and introduction. Managing this conditional layout wasn't straightforward initially.

7. Title Block Design Issues
One of the hardest parts was making the custom title signature box. I wanted a logo and text side-by-side, vertically aligned. The alignment and spacing between tabularx, minipage, and image height had to be carefully managed.

8. Symbol Confusions and Formatting Errors
I also faced random errors like:

“Missing $ inserted” due to symbols like ^, #, or \not used improperly.

Overfull boxes from long URLs or misaligned tabular columns.

Confusion with math symbols (not equal, approximate, imply arrows) and how to insert things like the Rupee sign or fading lines.
